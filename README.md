# Starx_Edge_CDN_Storage
A self-host simple static cdn storage.

## Performance
This is a non-test version.
PLEASE DO NOT USE IT TO PRODUCE ENV.

## Safety

I have added some simple URL filter at URL check,
But it is a very simple one.
Use it as your own risk.

## Get Started

PLEASE DON NOT USE `flask run` in your ENV.
This is just a built-in function for debug only!
Better use a wsgi server software like `Gunicorn`.

## Recommand Composition

I use `NGINX + Gunicorn` as my way.
But you can decide as your want.
